# Visual Regression Testing Lightning Talk

This repository is the code sample to go with my lightning talk on Visual Regression testing.

The talk and slides are available at: **_ADD URL HERE_**

I am working on a longer version of the talk.  It will contain a complete sample project
rather than just test files.  If you'd like updates, please follow this repository.
